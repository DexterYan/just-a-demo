{"prompt":"How to install Highly Available K8s->", "completion":"\n\ncurl https://kurl.sh/latest | sudo bash -s ha.\nHA installs will prompt and wait for an optional load balancer address to be provided that can route external and internal traffic to the API servers. In the absence of a load balancer address, kURL will enable the EKCO add-on's internal load balancer. (If EKCO 0.11.0+ is not available, then kURL will default to using the first primary instead of a load balancer. This is not recommended for production installs.) This prompt can be bypassed during the install process by specifying enableInternalLoadBalancer: true in the kURL yaml spec for the EKCO add-on."}
